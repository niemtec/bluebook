- [[Plato]] suggests that the prisoners would begin a 'game' of guessing which shadow would appear next.  
- If one of the prisoners were to correctly guess, the other would praise him as clever and say that he was a master of nature.

> [!note]
>The Game represents how people believe that one person can be a ‘master’ when they have knowledge of the empirical world. [[Plato]] demonstrates that this master does not actually know any truth, and suggests that it is ridiculous to admire someone like this.
